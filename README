This product works on the idea of what would make music more discoverable. Discoverability is possibly on of the most important things when it comes to content of any kind, and while fields such as video creation have reinvisioned new ways of discoverability through algorithms, discovering music is relatively stil archaic, relying on mainly suggestions of friends or music streaming sites themselves. The aim of this product is to create a new way to discover music, using the upvote system to create user curated playlists for all to listen to. We wish to be able to bring together people of all music tastes to create playlists that will give everyone something they like, so much so, that one day someone might just say, "Put on a SoundSource playlist."
